# TRISTAR Test

This repository is a basic programming test for TRISTAR (www.star3.com). If you're taking this test, your goal is to make the integration tests work that are located in the [PersonIntegrationTests](TRISTAR.Test.Tests\PersonIntegrationTests.cs) file. Instructions are intentionally vague, as being able to complete a task without explicit instructions is part of the test.
